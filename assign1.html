        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or <small>HTML is the standard markup language for documents 
            designed to be displayed in a web browser.</small> It defines the meaning and structure of web 
            content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <article>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. 
            A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it
            <!--All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, -->consisting of a set of tags and attributes.
             HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web 
             browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the 
             characteristics of an element.
